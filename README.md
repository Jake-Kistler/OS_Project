This is a rust version of the projects that I was asked to do in my OS class. 

Project 1:
Implement a PCB (Process control board) that takes a file in the form of input1.txt and creates a main memory that can store the processes described in the file. Implement a function that can run the commands in memory and display some metrics over the process(more on this later)

Project 2:
Implement a round-robin with a time slice CPU scheduling algorithm. Also, develop the I/O waiting queue and handle when a process runs out of its allocated time.

Project 3:
Implement memory coalescence in main memory and only load jobs as memory becomes available
